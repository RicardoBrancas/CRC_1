# An Analysis of the Portuguese Section of Wikipedia

This repository contains the source code and data associated with the first project of the Complex Networks course.

The three main directories `java`, `cpp` and `python` contain the source code itself, while the root contains the data, the intermediate files,
plots, graphs and report source code.

The report itself is in the file report.tex

## Java
In java directoy, you can find some source files, and webgraph and it's dependencies.


## C++
The only `C++` file is a small program used to convert from edge list to adjecency list.


## Python
The python script is what's responsible for reading all the values computed by webgraph and generating the figures used in the report, as well as computing some simple measures.
